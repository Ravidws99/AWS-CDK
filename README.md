# AWS-Python-CDK-EC2-Shutdown-Lambda

In this project created a lambda using the AWS Python CDK, CodePipeline, and CodeCommit that cuts off any active ec2 instances within my AWS account. I also added the Eventbrdge rule that triggers everyday to check for the existng active ec2 instances and shuts them off.
